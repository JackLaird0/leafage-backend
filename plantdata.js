In the South, though, they appreciate protection at midday and do best under a high canopy of light shade. While daylilies will grow in ordinary garden soil and are not fussy about pH, they perform magnificently in soils that have been generously amended with organic matter--compost, rotted leaves, or well-aged manure. Moisture is the other key to growing really spectacular daylilies. Although their plump storage roots keep them going in times of drought and guarantee survival, an abundance of water makes all the difference to the quality and quantity of the flowers.

While daylilies will grow in ordinary garden soil and are not fussy about pH, they perform magnificently in soils that have been generously amended with organic matter--compost, rotted leaves, or well-aged manure. Moisture is the other key to growing really spectacular daylilies. Although their plump storage roots keep them going in times of drought and guarantee survival, an abundance of water makes all the difference to the quality and quantity of the flowers.
