Plant them among shrubs or other plants so that the base of the stem is shaded and the head will be in the sun. This technique prevents the soil above the bulb from drying out too quickly, which can adversely affect any roots produced by the stem before it emerges from the soil. A common mistake is not planting lilies deep enough. Put 6 inches of soil over the top of them to keep them from flopping over.

They bloom admirably in six hours of sun and will make do with less, but in the North, the more sun they get, the better. In the South, though, they appreciate protection at midday and do best under a high canopy of light shade. While daylilies will grow in ordinary garden soil and are not fussy about pH, they perform magnificently in soils that have been generously amended with organic matter--compost, rotted leaves, or well-aged manure. Moisture is the other key to growing really spectacular daylilies. Although their plump storage roots keep them going in times of drought and guarantee survival, an abundance of water makes all the difference to the quality and quantity of the flowers.
